ImagineOCR represents a fundamental restructuring of image-to-text software. Abandoning previous principles emphasising static models of orthography, imagine OCR approaches OCR as the province of object detection. Accordingly, it views each character on a page as a discrete object and allows training of a custom faster-rcnn implementation given as little as a single instance of the objects (read: characters) to be detected.
