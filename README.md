ImagineOCR represents a fundamental restructuring of image-to-text software. Abandoning previous principles emphasising static models of orthography, imagine OCR approaches OCR as the province of object detection. Accordingly, it views each character on a page as a discrete object and allows training of a custom faster-rcnn implementation given as little as a single instance of the objects (read: characters) to be detected. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

#### Virtual Environment Set Up
We recommend setting up ImagineOCR in a new python virtual environment to avoid conflicting dependencies. To facilitate this, we've included a copy of our `environment.yml`. Simply enter the following command to create a virtual environment.
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
**Note that while we use `conda`, any virtual environment solution will work.**

### Installation

#### Initialising Submodules

ImagineOCR ships with [LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg) and [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) as `submodules` and requires their installation before proceeding. Please see the [instructions for installing LabelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg#installation) and the [instructions for installing Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md).

**Note that the virtual environment created above already includes the dependencies required by these project. There is no need to run any `conda install` or `pip install` commands.**
